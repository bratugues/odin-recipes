    <h2>Crispy-bottomed, juicy dumplings filled with seasoned pork and vegetables, served with a savory soy dipping sauce—perfect for sharing or enjoying as a meal.</h2>
    <p>These pan-fried dumplings, often called gyoza or potstickers, are a beloved dish across Asia and a staple of cozy homemade meals. With a golden, crispy base and a juicy, flavorful filling, they strike the perfect balance between texture and taste. Whether served as a snack, appetizer, or main course, dumplings never fail to impress. The best part? You can make a batch ahead of time and freeze them for quick meals whenever the craving hits.</p>
    <p>This version features a classic pork and cabbage filling enhanced with garlic, ginger, soy sauce, and sesame oil. The dumplings are first seared to create that iconic crispy bottom, then gently steamed in the same pan to cook the filling through—no need for special equipment. Paired with a simple dipping sauce, these dumplings are incredibly satisfying and fun to make, especially with friends or family.</p>
